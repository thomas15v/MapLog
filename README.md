MapLog
======

A minecraft Plugin that logs whatever your players are doing with your map.

This plugin needs to do the following. 

- Logging block changes
- rollback changes
- undo rollback
- restore

Needs to support the following storage systems
- Flatfile (currently prefered)
- mysql (not sure if this will get possible)

Hopefully will get a multi-plugin that supports:
- Sponge (prefered)
- Granite
- MinecraftAPI
- uch rainbow uch uch

Constributing
======
- Make sure you add some Unit tests to confirm that your code works.
